          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Welcome to HealthBridge, the ultimate solution for hospital management. We are a team of passionate professionals who believe in using technology to revolutionize the healthcare industry. Our mission is to provide hospitals with the tools they need to streamline their operations, improve patient care, and ultimately save lives.</p>
          <p>Pregnancy is a challenging time for women, and there are many important aspects to manage. During the first visit to the hospital, pregnant women are typically given a book to keep track of their medical history. However, the need to bring this book to every appointment can be difficult, and forgetting or misplacing it can result in the loss of important medical information.</p>
          <p>This can have serious consequences, such as the administration of incorrect medication, which can harm both the mother and the baby. Therefore, it is crucial to have a reliable and accessible system for managing a pregnant woman's medical history that can be easily updated and accessed by healthcare providers.</p>
          <p>As someone who has witnessed the challenges faced by pregnant women in managing their medical histories, we were inspired to create a solution that would make it easier for them to keep track of their important medical information. Seeing the potential consequences of lost or misplaced medical records, we wanted to create a tool that could help alleviate some of the stress and risks associated with managing medical histories during pregnancy. Thus, the idea for our project was born.</p>
          <p>As a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, we are proud to share our work and hope that it will inspire others to create meaningful tools that can improve the lives of those around them. </p>
          <p>Thank you for considering HealthBridge as your hospital management system. We look forward to helping you take your operations to the next level.</p>
